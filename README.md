A little application that handles texting a song title to a Twilio number, looks up a song on the Spotify API, and then calls you back with a song clip.

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
